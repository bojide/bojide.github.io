            3 Tier Static Website on AWS
          </a><br>
          Designed and deployed a highly available, secure, and scalable web application on AWS using Route 53,
          Application Load Balancer, Auto Scaling EC2 instances across multiple AZs, and NAT Gateways.
          Ensured security with private subnets, IAM, SSL/TLS via Certificate Manager, and
          EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint for admin access.

            Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
          </a><br>
          Built and automated a 3-tier AWS infrastructure (web, app, and database) using Terraform, provisioning VPCs, subnets, security groups, ALB, EC2 Auto Scaling, and RDS with modular code and remote state management (S3 + DynamoDB). Designed and deployed a secure, highly available architecture by separating the public web tier, private application tier, and private database tier to ensure scalability, reliability, and best-practice security. Deployed the project under my custom domain babajideajisafe.com to showcase real-world implementation. Just let me know, and I will run the "terraform apply -auto-approve" command on my VSCode during our meeting.

            CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
          </a><br>
          I built a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the entire workflow—from code commits through build, test, and deployment. The pipeline improved release speed, reduced errors, and ensured consistent deployments, while reinforcing modern DevOps best practices for scalable and reliable projects..
